# Sami's AE Infinity

A Minecraft mod that adds infinity storage cells for Applied Energistics 2. This mod is built by taking code and concepts from [ExtendedAE] and [MEGA Cells](https://github.com/62832/MEGACells) mods and extending them. As such, all credits go to Glodblock and 62832.

# What does this mod do differently?

Compression. Infinity cells don't have compression, but this mod does. That's it so far. Give me your ideas, I'll try to implement them!

# What is planned on being added?
- Infinity Mekanism chemical cells
- Infinity AppliedFlux FE cells
